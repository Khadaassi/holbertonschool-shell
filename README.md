# SHELL

## Summary:

The term "Shell" can refer to two distinct concepts: the shell as a command-line user interface and the shell as a scripting language. Here is a summary of these two aspects:

* **Shell as a Command-Line User Interface:**
  * **Definition:** The shell is a command-line interface that allows the user to interact with the operating system by entering commands.

  * **Basic Commands:**
    * `cd`: Change directory.
    * `ls`: List the contents of a directory.
    * `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
    * `cp`: Copy files or directories.
    * `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
    * `rm`: Remove files or directories.
    * `echo`: Display text to the standard output.
    * `cat`: Display the contents of a file.

  * **Advanced Operations:**
    * **Redirection (`>`, `>>`):** Redirect output to a file.
    * **Pipe (`|`):** Pass the output of one command as input to another.
    * **Environment Variables:** Store information useful to the system.
    * **Alias:** Create shortcuts for frequently used commands.
